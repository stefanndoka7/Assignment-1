# Assigment 1
This project is my first graded C++ assignment! 
Since I chose my interest to be 'metronomes', I made a program that asks for the last song the user listened to, its beats per minute, and its length. 
How long a song may be is irrelevant for the purposes of a metronome, but asking for the song name and its bpm wouldn't be enough to fulfill what the assignment was asking for.

The program then outputs a message that contains the inputs and some new information related to the inputs, the total beats of the song and the length of one beat in seconds.
